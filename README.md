# Virtual Store Wk 8

## Phase 1:

Written in React. In this first phase, our goal is to setup the basic scaffolding of the application with initial styling and basic behaviors. This initial build sets up the file structure and state management so that we can progressively build this application in a scalable manner.

## User Stories:

1. As a user, I expect to see a list of available product categories in the store so that I can easily browse products

2. As a user, I want to choose a category and see a list of all available products matching that category

3. As a user, I want a clean, easy to use user interface so that I can shop the online store with confidence.

## User Stories:

1. As a user, I want to choose from products in the list and add them to my shopping cart

2. As a user, I want to see the products that I’ve added to my shopping cart so that

3. As a user, I want to change the quantity of items I intend to purchase in my shopping cart

4. As a user, I want to be able to remove an item from my shopping cart
